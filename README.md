#Data Structures By Horowitz in C++ to iPython Notebook

## About

Python implementation of the examples in the text book [Fundamentals of Data Structures in C++ by E.Horowitz, S.Sahni and Mehta](http://www.amazon.in/dp/8173716064/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_P0I9sb188T11M).
This is a part of my contribution to the textbook companionship project organized by the [FOSSEE](http://python.fossee.in/) initiative of [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/)

## Installation and Dependencies

The python codes are written in [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) Version 2.0 - Development Build as on Jan 2014:

To install ipython in debian based systems like Debian:
    
    sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook

To install ipython in Fedora 18 and Newer:
    
    sudo yum install python-ipython-notebook

To check version:
    
    ipython --version

If the version is not 2.0, [use the development build](https://github.com/ipython/ipython)

Clone the repo:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/ipython/ipython.git

Move into the directory

    cd ipython

Do a system wide install :

    sudo python setup.py install

Matrix Operations are carried out via Numpy libraries.
To get the Scipy libraries (which include numpy):

    sudo apt-get install python-scipy

or 

    sudo yum install python-scipy

Once all the packages and dependencies are installed.

Clone the repository and move into it:

    git clone https://github.com/rvraghav93/Data-Structures-By-Horowitz-in-Python.git DataStructPy
    cd DataStructPy

Move into the required chapter (Replace N by chapter number):

    cd Chapter\ N

Run IPython Notebook

    sudo ipython notebook
